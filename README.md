# gcal-sync

gcal-sync synchronizes Google Calendar events to another account via Google Calendar API.

You can set simple rules to adjust time of created event.

# Usecase

- Create an event on business calendar to block a period when an event is created on private calendar.

# Motivation

It bothers me to create an event on calendar for business just for blocking the period when I create a event on calendar for private.
You can do this by using like Zapier if you want to copy ALL events to another account.
But for example, it is difficult & bothered to set complicated rules on Zapier. Plus, executing such task is a paid plan!
